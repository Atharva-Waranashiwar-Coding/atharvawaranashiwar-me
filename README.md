# Atharva Waranashiwar's Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator, and deployed via GitHub Pages using automated GitHub Actions.

## Features

- **Fast and Lightweight**: Built using Hugo for fast load times and optimal performance.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a good browsing experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated deployment to GitHub Pages for efficient content updates.

## Prerequisites

Before you can build and run this site locally, you need to have the following installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Hugo (Extended Version)](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) - make sure to install the extended version required for SCSS/SASS.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Atharva-Waranashiwar-Coding/atharvawaranashiwar-me.git
cd atharvawaranashiwar-me
```

### Submodules

If the site uses themes or other Git submodules, initialize and update them with:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Running Locally

To start the Hugo server locally, run:

```bash
hugo server
```

This command will start the Hugo live server. You can view your site at `http://localhost:1313`.

## Deployment

Deployment is handled automatically by GitHub Actions. Any push to the `main` branch triggers the build and deployment process to the `gh-pages` branch, which is configured to serve the GitHub Pages site.
